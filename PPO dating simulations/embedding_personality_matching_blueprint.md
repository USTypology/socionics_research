## High-Level Flow

**Text → Embed → Calibrate → Type (probabilities) → Compatibility score → Policy (bandit/RL)**

- Pretrain on **synthetic persona corpus** to shape the embedding space.
- Build **type prototypes** (multi-centroid) in that space.
- **Adapt** to real dating chats (small but essential).
- Infer **distributions** over MBTI, Big Five, Socionics (not hard labels).
- Learn a **compatibility model** using embeddings and type distributions.
- Optimize **who-to-show** (and optionally **first-message prompts**) via contextual bandits; consider PPO later under constraints.

---

## Pretraining on Synthetic Personas

**Model:** Transformer encoder (≈150–300M params). Use mean-pooled or `[CLS]` embedding \( z \in \mathbb{R}^d \).

**Objectives (weighted sum):**
1) **Supervised contrastive / InfoNCE** on type labels  
For batch \( B \), temperature \( \tau \):
```text
L_supcon = - Σ_i (1/|P(i)|) Σ_{p∈P(i)} log [ exp(sim(z_i,z_p)/τ) / Σ_{a≠i} exp(sim(z_i,z_a)/τ) ]
```
2) **Multi-task heads** (MBTI 16-way, Socionics 16-way, Big Five 10 facets): cross-entropy with **label smoothing** (e.g., ε=0.1).  
3) **Style-invariance**: augmentations (span masking, paraphrase, emoji/no-emoji, case & punctuation jitter), plus SimCLR-style instance discrimination.

**Batching tips:**
- Stratify by persona & scene for diverse positives/negatives.
- Mix sequence lengths to avoid shortcut cues.

---

## Type Prototypes & Similarity-Based Typing

After pretraining, compute **per-type prototypes**:
```text
c_k = (1/N_k) Σ_{i:y_i=k} normalize(z_i)
```
Use **multiple prototypes per type** (e.g., K-means, m=3) to cover sub-modes: \( {c_{k,1},…,c_{k,m}} \).

**Typing by similarity** (log-sum-exp over sub-prototypes):
```text
s_k = log Σ_{j=1..m} exp( α * cos(z, c_{k,j}) )
p(y=k|z) = softmax( s_k / T )
```
with learnable scale **α** and temperature **T** (calibrated on real data).

---

## Domain Adaptation to Real Dating Chats

Even a few thousand consented snippets help a lot.

**A. Adversarial domain adaptation**
- Add domain classifier \( D(z)∈{synthetic, real} \); apply gradient reversal:
```text
min_{enc,heads} max_{D}  L_task + γ * L_supcon - β * L_domain
```

**B. Importance weighting**
- Train a lightweight discriminator (“real vs synthetic”) to estimate density ratio \( w(x)=p_real(x)/p_syn(x) \). Weight synthetic losses by \( w(x) \).

**C. Prototype recalibration**
- Blend real & synthetic centroids with higher real weight \( η \):
```text
c_{k,j} ← normalize( η * mean_real + (1-η) * mean_syn )
```

**D. Temperature scaling**
- Fit **T** on held-out real dev set to minimize **ECE** (confidence calibration).

---

## Probabilistic Typing Outputs

For each taxonomy (MBTI, Socionics, Big Five facets):
- Output **probability vectors** \( p^{MBTI}, p^{Soc}, p^{Big5} \).  
- Prefer **distributions** over hard assignments; report uncertainty (entropy, max-prob, augmentation disagreement).

**Optional coupling:** Regularize MBTI letters with a Big-Five–induced prior via KL:
```text
L_KL = Σ_letters KL( p_letter  ||  q_letter(Big5) )
```

---

## Compatibility Modeling

Use both routes and ensemble them:

### (a) Type×Type table with Bayesian smoothing
Estimate \( θ_{ab}=P(	ext{good outcome} | type=a, type=b) \) (good outcome = reply, mutual like, depth).  
Apply hierarchical smoothing (e.g., Beta priors + graph Laplacian over type lattice). Use posterior mean or sample for uncertainty-aware ranking.

### (b) Two-tower contrastive compatibility
- Tower A encodes user A: \( z_A \) + type logits; Tower B for user B.  
- Score: \( g(z_A,z_B)=\cos(W_A[z_A;π_A], W_B[z_B;π_B]) \).  
- Train with InfoNCE / BPR on pair outcomes, with exposure correction (IPS/DR) for logging bias.

**Final compatibility score:**
```text
Compat(A,B) = λ * E[θ_{a,b}] + (1-λ) * g(z_A,z_B)
```
tune **λ** via offline validation.

---

## Policy Optimization (Bandits → PPO)

- Start with **contextual bandits** (Thompson Sampling / LinUCB) using features:  
  \([z_A, π_A, z_B, π_B, recency, diversity bins] \).  
- Log **propensities** for unbiased off-policy evaluation (IPS/DR/Switch-DR).  
- After learning a stable reward model \( \hat{R} \) from preferences/outcomes, consider **PPO** to fine-tune a slate policy (who to show, order, and maybe opener prompts) under constraints: minimum diversity, exposure caps, and safety filters.

## Minimal Training Loop (Pseudocode)

```python
# 1) Pretrain on synthetic personas
for batch in synthetic_loader:
    z = encoder(batch.text)                    # [B, d]
    loss_supcon = supcon_loss(z, batch.type)   # MBTI/Soc labels
    logits = heads(z)                          # dict of task logits
    loss_ce = sum(ce(lsmooth(logits[t]), y[t]) for t in tasks)
    loss = w1*loss_supcon + w2*loss_ce
    loss.backward(); opt.step(); opt.zero_grad()

# 2) Build multi-centroid prototypes
protos = build_multimode_prototypes(encoder, synthetic_loader, per_type_k=3)

# 3) Domain adaptation (mixed real + synthetic)
for batch in mixed_loader:
    z = encoder(batch.text)
    task_loss = task_losses(z, batch.labels)
    domain_logits = domain_head(grad_reverse(z))
    loss_domain = bce(domain_logits, batch.is_real)
    loss = task_loss + gamma*supcon_loss(z, batch.type) - beta*loss_domain * weight(batch)
    loss.backward(); opt.step(); opt.zero_grad()

# 4) Typing by similarity
def type_probs(z, protos, alpha, T):
    sims = [logsumexp(alpha * cosine(z, Cs)) for Cs in protos.by_type()]
    return softmax(stack(sims)/T, dim=-1)
```

## Evaluation Plan

**Typing:**
- Accuracy/F1 if any ground-truth exists; **ECE** for calibration; MAP over MBTI letters.
- Robustness to augmentations; performance vs. message length; register/language shifts.

**Compatibility & policy:**
- Offline: **AUC** for next-reply prediction; **IPS/DR / Switch-DR** for counterfactual eval; calibration of uplift.
- Online: reply rate, mutual likes, 24‑h depth, **heterogeneous treatment effects** by cohorts; **fairness** (exposure & success parity across demographics and type distributions).
- Add **diversity** & **serendipity** metrics to avoid echo chambers.

---

## Data Governance & Safety

- **Explicit consent** to use chats; PII scrubbing; clear retention limits.
- **Synthetic persona data** for pretraining only; don’t expose celebrity likeness in product UX.
- **Bias audits**: constrain exposure floors, monitor disparate impact, explainability for inferred traits.
- **Transparency & control**: let users view/edit their inferred traits or opt out.

---

## Practical Knobs That Move the Needle

- Multiple **short windows** per chat (2–5 turns) rather than long docs.
- Add **behavioral deltas** (e.g., sentiment shift, initiative) to towers.
- Keep **embedding dim** modest (256–768); make temperature **learnable**.
- **EMA** re-centering of prototypes with newest real data.
- Ensemble with a **bag‑of‑ngrams linear probe** for a leak‑resistant baseline.
- Start with **bandits**; only move to PPO after confidence in reward modeling.

---

### TL;DR
Use massive synthetic persona data to shape a **contrastive, multi-task embedding space**, build **multi-centroid type prototypes**, then **domain-adapt and calibrate** on a small real set. Output **probabilistic** personality distributions, learn **behavior-aware compatibility**, and optimize exposure with **bandits** → maybe **PPO** later under strict safeguards.
