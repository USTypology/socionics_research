# Ethics & Consent Framework (v0.2)

**Updated**: 2025-08-16  
**Status**: IRB-ready with multi-tier consent system

**Purpose**: Provide a comprehensive framework for IRB/ethics committee submission and participant-facing consent materials for Socionics behavioral data collection with privacy-first design.

## 2. Study Overview (Template)
Title: Information Metabolism Behavioral Corpus Project
Purpose: Collect multi-modal behavioral data to evaluate the empirical structure and interpersonal predictive claims of Socionics constructs.
Primary Outcomes: Reliability of indicators; predictive incremental validity over Big Five; stability of type distributions; dyadic interaction quality metrics.

## 3. Participant Population
- Adults (18+), international, fluent in English (Phase 1).
- Recruitment: Online advertisement, academic mailing lists, snowball referrals.
- Inclusion: Consent capability, stable internet.
- Exclusion: Severe hearing/speech impairment (unless accessible workflow provided in later phase), inability to provide informed consent.

## 4. Data Collected
- Video, audio, text transcripts.
- Survey responses (demographics, personality inventories, self-typing).
- Behavioral annotations (derived, not directly provided by participant).
- Derived computational features (linguistic, prosodic, interactional).

## 5. Risks
- Privacy breach (mitigated by de-identification, secure storage).
- Psychological discomfort during self-reflection tasks.
- Misinterpretation or misuse of tentative type feedback (avoid providing unvalidated feedback early).

## 6. Risk Mitigation
- Clear disclaimers: Experimental constructs, not diagnostic.
- Option to skip any question; withdraw anytime.
- Tiered data sharing: raw media restricted; derived features anonymized.
- Data minimization (collect only necessary variables).

## 7. Benefits
- Contribution to scientific evaluation of under-researched typological framework.
- Personal insight (only after validation thresholds met).
- Open dataset resource for broader research community (anonymized).

## 8. Consent Elements (Participant-Facing)
1. Project purpose & experimental nature.
2. What participation involves (time: ~60 minutes baseline session).
3. Data types collected & storage duration.
4. Voluntary nature & withdrawal rights.
5. Confidentiality & data sharing tiers.
6. Potential risks & mitigations.
7. Contact information (PI, ethics board).
8. Statement of consent (checkbox + digital signature).

## 9. Data Governance
- Governance committee (PI + data steward + external advisor).
- Data access request process (proposal form, minimal necessary access principle).
- Annual audit of access logs.

## 10. Retention & Destruction
- Retention: 10 years (academic standard) unless withdrawal.
- Destruction: Secure deletion (media shredding, cryptographic erase) within 30 days of withdrawal request.

## 11. De-identification Protocol
- Replace names with random IDs at ingestion.
- Automatic redaction: Named entity recognition + manual QA subset.
- Voice transformation optional (pitch shifting) for public releases if needed.

## 12. International Considerations
- GDPR: lawful basis = consent; data subject rights interface provided.
- US: HIPAA not applicable (non-clinical) but follow best practices.

## 13. Data Sharing Tiers
| Tier | Contents | Access Level |
|------|----------|-------------|
| 0 | Raw media (video/audio) | Restricted internal |
| 1 | Transcripts (de-identified) | Approved researchers (DUA) |
| 2 | Derived features (anonymized) | Public open data |
| 3 | Aggregated statistics | Public |

## 14. Incident Response
- Report potential breach within 72 hours to oversight body.
- Temporary suspension of data access pipeline pending review.
- Root cause analysis + remediation log.

## 15. Participant Feedback Policy
- Provide validated aggregate findings via periodic newsletter.
- Individual provisional type feedback only after measurement reliability benchmarks reached.

## 16. Appendices (To Develop)
- Detailed DUA template.
- Withdrawal request form.
- FAQ for participants.
- Data dictionary summary.

## 17. Next Steps
- Draft full IRB application narrative.
- Translate consent form for multilingual expansion.
- Implement electronic consent logging & version tracking.
