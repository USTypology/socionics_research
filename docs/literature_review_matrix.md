## Quality Scoring Heuristic
1 = speculative / low transparency
2 = limited methods / partial reporting
3 = conceptual clarity but limited data rigor
4 = solid empirical design or robust review
5 = high rigor, transparency, replicable methods

## Gaps Identified (Initial)
- Absence of large-N Socionics validation studies in indexed journals.
- Lack of preregistered intertype relational outcome studies.
- Scarcity of cross-cultural measurement invariance analyses.

## Pipeline for Expansion
1. Systematic search (databases: Scopus, PsycINFO; terms: "Socionics", "information metabolism", "intertype relations").
2. Snowball citation tracking from primary sources.
3. Inclusion filters (English/Russian/Lithuanian) with translation summary abstracts.
4. Dual coder quality scoring; resolve discrepancies by consensus.
5. Export matrix to CSV & maintain versioned updates.

## Planned Columns (Future)
- preregistration_id
- open_data (boolean)
- effect_sizes_reported (boolean)
- statistical_power_estimate

## Next Actions
- Draft search strings & PRISMA-style flow chart template.
- Add 20 additional Socionics community sources tagged low rigor for completeness.
- Translate two core regional articles; summarize methods.
